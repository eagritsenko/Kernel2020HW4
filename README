A module which prints the number of characters entered on PS/2 keyboard at each time interval (60 sec by default) to dmesg.

Time interval is defined by MSEC_TIME_INTERVAL in the code begining.

As of now only first code set is supported. It has to be used. Reported character count won't be correct otherwise.
NumPad number keys are always assumed to always be on (tracking numlock trigger value is not supported).

Multimedia keys are handled correctly.
